# Agent Guidelines

Follow these documentation rules for this repo:

- When you change user-facing behavior or UI copy, update the docs.
  - Update the README Features list for new or changed capabilities.
  - Update relevant files in docs/ (for example: UX_PLAN.md).
- When you add/finish tasks, update docs/TASKS.md.
  - Only mark a task as "done" after tests are green.
- If no documentation updates are needed, call that out explicitly.
